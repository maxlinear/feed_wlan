In this folder there are 2 special folders:

    - "patches":
        This folder contains special MaxLinear commits saved in the form of patches. These patches
        are meant to be uploaded manually by a developer.

        PATCHES CONTAINED IN THIS FOLDER MUST START WITH 9000

        E.g. 9000-WLANRTSYS-45977-OneWiFi-Open-source-hostapd-integrat.patch
        (you can use --start-number=9000 with format-patch Git command)

    - "patches_external":
        This folder contains patches generated automatically by DevOps scripts. Each time a new internal
        MaxLinear commit is merged, its corresponding patch file will be added to this subfolder.

        Patches in this folder may be overwritten without further notice!

Please refer to the README located at the root of this repository for more information.
